            <h2>I am Sven Metselaars.</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently in my final year of the Software Development program.  
                I enjoy collaborating with colleagues and classmates on projects, as I get a lot of energy from teamwork and a positive team dynamic.  
                At the same time, I am perfectly capable of working independently toward a clear goal.  
                I enjoy learning new things and find it rewarding to create something that others can truly benefit from.

                    <h3>Tic Tac Chess</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tic Tac Chess is a two-player strategy game that combines the logic of Tic Tac Toe with the movement mechanics of chess. 
                        Each player controls chess pieces, aiming to align their three chosen pieces in a row to win. 
                        Unlike traditional chess, no pieces can be captured, so every move requires careful planning and foresight.

                        I developed the game in C# (Windows Forms), handling turn-based logic, valid chess movement rules, and win detection. 
                        Later, I connected it to an Arduino-powered robot arm that could physically move the pieces on a real board. 
                        This project deepened my skills in object-oriented programming, game logic design, and integrating hardware with software.

                        Quizmester is a C# quiz application that allows users to register, log in, and play timed quizzes from a database. 
                        Players can choose categories, answer randomized multiple-choice questions, and compete for a spot on the top 10 leaderboard. 
                        The app includes a full CRUD system for an administrator to manage users and questions.

                        I built this project using C# and MySQL. It strengthened my understanding of database integration, user authentication, and object-oriented programming in C#.

                        It’s built with the MVC architecture and features a full CRUD system for managing products, categories, and images. 
                        Administrators can log in to add, edit, or delete products, while users can explore available CDs.

                        I developed this project using Laravel, Blade templates, and MySQL, learning how to structure scalable web apps, 
                        manage authentication, and connect frontend and backend through the MVC pattern.

                            When a move is made in the software, the Arduino receives coordinates and precisely picks up 
                            the piece, moves it to the new position, and places it down. This bridges the digital game

                            The administrator panel provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing users and questions. 
                            Admins can add new questions to any category, edit existing questions, remove inappropriate content, 
                            and manage user accounts. This ensures quiz quality remains high and users have a safe, enjoyable experience. 
                            The admin interface is intuitive and powerful, making content management straightforward.
